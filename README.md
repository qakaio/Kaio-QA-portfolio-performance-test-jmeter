## ðŸ“Š Test Example

In a test with **10 simultaneous users** on the public API **JSONPlaceholder**:  

- **Average response time:** 512 ms  
- **Minimum response time:** 53 ms  
- **Maximum response time:** 1326 ms  
- **Error rate:** 0%  
- **Throughput:** 2.2 requests/sec  
- **Data transfer rate:** 15.02 KB/s  

âœ… These results indicate that the API remained stable under the applied load, with acceptable response times for the simulated users. Despite the peak of 1326 ms, the **average response time remained consistent**, demonstrating that the API can handle multiple simultaneous requests without failures.

## âœ¨ Features

- Load testing with multiple virtual users  
- Monitoring response times, throughput, and error rates  
- Generating detailed performance reports  
- Configurable test plans for different scenarios

## ðŸ›  How to Run the Tests

1. **Install JMeter**: [Apache JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi)  
2. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone Kaio-QA-portfolio-performance-test-jmeter
   cd Kaio-QA-portfolio-performance-test-jmeter
   ```  
3. **Open the `.jmx` test plan** in JMeter  
4. **Adjust parameters** (number of users, ramp-up time, loops, etc.) as needed  
5. **Run the test** by clicking the **Start** button  
6. **Analyze the results** using listeners or export them as HTML/CSV reports
